Considerations about Optimization
-------------------------------------------------
I used to create a single VB for all widgets, which was then proved to be lack of flexibility.
Now each widget has its own VB. Given the fact that text charactors are treated like widgets, the performance becomes unbearable. 20fps for a simple scene.

There are 2 reasons for the performance hit:
i) Each charactor has a underlying VB, thus incurrs a draw call each frame
ii) Operations like move/resize/rotation should not directly write into GPU vertices in the dynamic VB. They should be performed by matrix transformations via cbuffer. A map/unmap to VB should only be done when it is absolutely necessary()

Reason 1 is okay for sake of simpilicity and flexibility.
Reason 2 is totally a shitty design.
